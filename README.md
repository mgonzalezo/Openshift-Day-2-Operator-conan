## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgonzalezo/Openshift-Day-2-Operator-conan.git
cd Openshift-Day-2-Operator-conan
```

### 2. Download Product Data

1. Access the **"Reports"** section at https://productpages.redhat.com/
2. Navigate to the **"Exports"** section
3. Select **"Google Sheets Export"**
4. Download the **CSV file** to the same folder as this repository (the tool now uses CSV format for better performance)

### 3. Set Up Python Environment

## Usage

The tool will automatically:

1. **Load** the downloaded CSV file from Red Hat Product Pages
2. **Parse** the operator-to-product mappings from `source.txt`
3. **Filter** results to show only future releases (after current date)
4. **Group** operators by their product suites
5. **Display** the closest 2 releases per product suite for focused analysis
6. **Export** results to `results.txt` for offline review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No CSV file found"**
   - Ensure you've downloaded the CSV export from Red Hat Product Pages
   - Verify the file is in the same directory as the script
   - The tool looks for files starting with "Product-Pages-Export"

2. **"No future releases found"**
   - The tool only shows releases with GA dates after the current date
   - Check that the data contains upcoming releases for your operators

3. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **"SettingWithCopyWarning"**
   - This is a pandas warning and doesn't affect functionality
   - The tool continues to work normally despite this warning
